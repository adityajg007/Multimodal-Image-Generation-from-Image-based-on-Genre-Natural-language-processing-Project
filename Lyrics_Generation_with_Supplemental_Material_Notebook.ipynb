in the year 2000? Dad: Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream. But I'm afraid the end time is near. The cataclysmic apocalypse refered to in the scriptures of every hole book know to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed & corruption, where global monitary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of over cook rice. The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithfull citizens. Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins. Unsheilded by the O-zone they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the cering naked rays of light. Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government, leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax dodging corporations reek havok. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total world wide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutating, radiating, and horribly dis-figured hordes of satanic killers,?begged on revenge, but against home?, there are so few left alive. Starvation reins supreme, forcing unlucky survivers to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. Creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains.

You know its time that you really realize what this family is all about Cause about this time is when your gonna be able to join in And earn some real money and real cash But before you do that I wanna teach you a little bit about loyalty, The main name of this game is respect and loyalty. Family is a big thing when we do this kind of business Everything is with respect and when a family member Gets outta Line and another family don't like it one thing leads to another And the next thing you know, your gone And then your just a memory of me, My hearts broke then, but you gotta remember Theres always family and loyalty, Loyalty is the main thing. Obviously you know i don't make my money, I don't make all my cash from uh construction jobs we do and Uh sanitation and private stuff is all earned money through the family And since your of age now i think its time I taught you what coming into the family and respect is all about. So the first thing you gotta learn is the name respect, Tha means you don't cross nobody you don't go over the line, Once you go over that line theres no coming back Whether youre a member of the family or not. Thats when people get whacked And we don't want nobody whacked in our family So i gotta teach you the proper way of respect. When youre earning money, everybody earns, everybody eats bread. Its all about cash money thats what its all about making the money. So the first thing of business is this, you remember your name, You don't forgets your roots. You never ever ever disrespect anyone thats above you Especially your capo Especially the big time guys, those are the guys you listen to.

Dad: Well sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll all be peaches & cream. But I'm afraid the end time is near. The cataclysmic apocalypse refered to in the scriptures of every hole book know to mankind. It will be an era fraught with boundless greed & corruption, where global monitary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of over cook rice. The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithfull citizens. Around the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins. Unsheilded by the O-zone they have successfully depleted, left to bake in the cering naked rays of light. Wholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government, leaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves. Bloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax dodging corporations reek havok. Pissed off androids tired of being slaves to a godless & gutless system, where the rich get richer & the poor get fucked over and out, unleash total world wide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust, annihilating the terrified masses, leaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutating, radiating, and horribly dis-figured hordes of satanic killers,?begged on revenge, but against home?, there are so few left alive. Starvation reins supreme, forcing unlucky survivers to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. Creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains.
