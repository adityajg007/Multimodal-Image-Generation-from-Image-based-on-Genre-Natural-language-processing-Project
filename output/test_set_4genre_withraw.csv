The nations of the civilized world will collapse under the impressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithfull citizens.

Starvation reins supreme, forcing unlucky survivers to eat anything & anyone in their path. Massive earthquakes crack the planets crust like a hollow egg shell, causing unending volcanic eruptions. Creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison. Disease then circles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure laying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers, fall victim to merciless attacks at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains.

Turn your back to me","[""<POP>: You're music to my eyes I had to listen just to find you I like for you to let me sing along Give you a rhythm you feel I wanna learn your every line I wanna fill your empty spaces I want to play the part to reach your heart Sing you a song that you feel Love let your music be mine Sing while I harmonize Let your melodies fly in my direction Take me to your paradise On a musical ride I'm in love with your music baby You're music to my eyes Your voice is quite a view I heard a song and then I saw you I learned the lyrics and knew you were mine Dance the horizon with you I wanna sing you a sunrise And be the dawn I know will move you I'd like to be the strings on your guitar Touch me and play what you feel Love let your music be mine Sing while I harmonize Let your melodies fly in my direction Take me to your paradise On a musical ride I'm in love with your music baby\n\nby Lucky Rabbit\n\nFade to black\n\nGet right in the flow\n\nTurn your back to me<|endoftext|>""]"
